As a Foundational Black American, I am sick of you disgusting racists trying to pawn the Democrats as the lesser of two evils. Trump is a racist, but so is Biden.

Regardless of one being Christian and the other being (Shia) Moslem, it is very clear that the genetically inherent disposition of Azeri is superior to that of Armenians. If Azeri weren't Zio-allies I'd support them.

Azerbaijan is Israel's largest source of oil. Israel does everything they can down to support this threat to Iran down to putting Azeri products on shelves in groceries across Europe.

TRS didn't disavow or distance. They kept chumming around with and promoting Cantwell.

He openly said on video that he got a better deal from his charges in Charlottesville because of his cooperation with the authorities. The agent he reported to was an antifa cooperator that indicted RAM.   He was as devious as Milo.

TRS works with snitches, and that you would attempt to lie and deflect Cantwell's snitching marks you as a federal cooperator.

He was a federal informant in secret, until good people dug it out of him and called him out on it.

So the initial tweet on this thread says "just don't put the stock on it" but really what you need to say, at minimum, is "you should not even print the stock inside the US." At least, that's what we hope the minimum is. You're right, there's no precedent. It's undecided.

The FGC-9 is the inverse: it is clearly intended to be an SBR. Promotional video shows shoulder fire, display on Defcad frontpage shows stock.

The reason I am telling people to contact legal counsel for this is that there is no case law on it and nobody knows.   The configuration on the frontpage of Defcad is an SBR.

We do not know what the law is yet. Anyone partially printing an SBR but not turning it fully into one is on a new path, potentially a seriously criminal one. Their fate might be decided by 12 retards or on appeal

The FGC-9 is an SBR, not popular, not common, and illegal. If you can print it, you can print the stock. Is that constructive possession? We don't know.

I am, in fact, telling people to contact a legal authority on these issues, like FFLs and attorneys that specialize in gun law.   You are telling people it's legal when the honest answer is "there isn't case law yet, do you want to be a test case?"

You literally do not know what basic legal terms mean. Stop giving people legal advice.   Constructive intent is about mens rea, not having gun parts.

It is not a legal pistol being converted with accessories. It is an SBR by its displayed configuration.

A morality that replaces obligation with self-interested legalism is empty and leads one to the empty materialism that destabilizes society and paves the road to Hitlers and Merkels alike.

All these guys did was submit to the elites and encourage others to do so while they were propagating sickness throughout European society

But TRS is wrong, all the time, and have been at ground zero of all problems.

Literally absolutely nothing to do with this situation.   Fighting words are about inciting hatred in the target -- e.g. walking up to a black guy and calling him the n-word.   You are clueless, Go to school.

That is not incitement -- it is neither immanent or specific a threat.  "Kill that x" is a true threat/direction.   You don't know the jurisprudence.

In a trial, the defendant is supposed to be proven guilty.

DeRay is an absolute scumbag and should be treated as such, but hating him so bad that you let the courts arbitrarily bankrupt him with no evidence of incitement does his neoliberal friends in power a big favor.

Now any political dissident must not only prove his own innocence of the crime of conspiracy to incite violence (an inversion of the standard) but also the guilt of the government.

In this century, wars are fought on the virtues of materiel, not infantry. US is most powerful country in the world primarily because of superior aircraft carrier capacity.

Especially avoid groups with who had billed speakers at Charlottesville.   Start by knocking on the doors of your neighbors and asking if they need any help, especially in difficult times like these.

If you are part of a movement that includes FBI informants, we are not in the same movement. It is not infighting to purge federal informants. It is good opsec.

The Stormer simply told its guys to disassociate with TRS because of behaviors they refused to address, and you people constantly run around like scorned women attacking it.

If the FBI is good and it is chill to talk with them, we've already won! We control the government!

It wasn't just that he sat down and did an "economics debate" with a snitch, Striker actively white knighted for snitch Cantwell's federal snitching.

* [ 2 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403101642/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1245848343798038528): funny how the conversation keeps moving goalposts. "it didn't happen!" (lie) "they didn't support him!" (lie) "wasn't really snitching!" (lie) and now once all arguments are done "none of it matters!" (also a lie).

* [ 2 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200404091722/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1245844928007221248): The task is building a healthy political movement, and that can't be done as long as federal snitches and those who promote them are tolerated. It must be established that collaborating with FBI assets is unacceptable, or this is all just a joke to ruin good white men's lives.

Cantwell also said on Warski at the time of his motivations "I hate Ricky Vaughn and I wanted to ruin his life"   This one is shorter: https://www.altcensored.com/watch?v=wJBmDupowo4

Your desire to rewrite history is just like Holocaust mythologists. TRS's willful interactions with federal assets seem to shrink just like the number that died from 1933-1945 grows.

Your behavior is identical to Hebrews. "They hate us for no reason!" says the Heeb and wignat -- despite enumerated bullet points of bad behavior.

DS promotes radical thought while encouraging conservative presentation/lifestyle.

So yeah, sorry, praise of Brenton Tarrant is an inverse indicator of fed likelihood

There are literally thousands of downward departures  "substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense" (U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1.) given each year.

That you are cool with your crew hanging out with known snitches shows what kind of people you are.

There is only ever evidence of Cantwell informing on right-wingers.   And TRS promoted him after.

McNabb did too!  Morrakiu promoted Cantwell on his channel AFTER he filed criminal complaints against two WNs.

There are MULTIPLE instances where he snitched on right-wingers, either helping dox them to ZOG media or filing complaints on them to the feds. http://archive.fo/96RuJ

Yes, and they should do the same thing for others that do the same.   It also wasn't a mistake when they abandoned Heimbach when he started hanging out with the NSM and other goony freaks
* [ 2 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403020425/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1245826876968284161): Did DS give Cantwell the benefit of the doubt and help raise money for his legal defense? Yes. And it is the right thing to do, and they should still do it again for others  That Cantwell became a snitch instead of fighting his case is sad, but many will choose the easy route
* [ 2 April 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200403020425/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1245826876968284161): if TRS aren't federal informants, they sure love to hang out with them! and the ZOG machine surely doesn't steal their domains, charge their leaders with crimes, or deplatform them financially like DS gets. Hmm.

TRS continued to be chummy with the known federal informant, from Morrakiu to Striker.  Almost as if DS's support is contingent on not being a fed fucking snitch, and TRS's isn't.

He's never held a job, is a deadbeat father, ostentatiously displays petty wealth until he runs out all his money, avoids honest work like the plague, gets in constant interpersonal conflicts.  Richard Spencer is literally 90% of negro stereotypes in one person.

Almost as if people regularly do things to mitigate the ability for 12 prejudiced morons to destroy their lives. Almost as if your presentation and culture might affect the futures of those who print Defcad designs.

Is it an SBR modified to no longer be an SBR? Is the buffer still a stock facilitating shoulder fire? Well, that's between a federal prosecutor and a jury.   This thing seems like it is designed to invite ATF scrutiny.

The presentation on the frontpage of Defcad is in the configuration of an SBR. That's undeniable. Ask any FFL, any attorney who does gun stuff. In its primary presentation, it is a Title II SBR.

The NFA cares whether the gun is manufactured with intent to be fired from the shoulder -- and that'll be undeniable if US person gets caught with one of these, given that promotional video shown at its release shows shoulder fire.

It was all dumb liberals who hated me and wanted any excuse to send me to prison. So to prison I went, and waited for an appeals decision.

With promotional videos associated with the release showing it being shoulder fired.  And then your fate is in the hands of a jury.

But everyone making braces and similar exempt devices in the gun community have opinion letters from the ATF stating it isn't a stock. Nobody sane makes their own brace as a result

But Defcad is selling subscriptions to US 12 CFR 120.15 persons, and they really should thusly inform their customers:  as displayed on the frontpage of the site, this thing is a Title II SBR.

The machinery of much of the government in Weimar Germany was extremely incentivized to promote someone who believed the Treaty of Versailles should be discarded. Hitler rode that up.

You have to have some degree of capture of the state to accomplish anything.

He was assigned membership in the party and given a budget to grow it, as well as connections to consolidate existing political forces into it.  Hitler's rise was orchestrated by state forces.

LotS never "cut ties" -- Nationalist Front simply collapsed, due to the laughable trailer park incest culminating on Matt Parrott snitching out his partner and leader of the Fourth Reich to the cops and SPLC.
* [26 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190826173859/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1166036557729542145): Cantwell being a thing was a result of Mike Enoch putting his prison show on TRS. Anglin very regrettably promoted many TRS-orbiting personalities -- but the minute Cantwell's behavior changed and was exposed as a federal informant Anglin cut ties.  Hunter continued as his ally.

Dan Backer's name is on all of them. Then look at his other PACs.   Nehlen is a washed up loser, even his kids were faked. He went along with Dan Backer's plan so he could rent a Mexican wife for a year.

People supported him because of that lie, and stopped supporting because of alliance with the cuck boxers.

Nehlen was a fraud and GOP establishment operative from the beginning.

* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185528/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164608869554933760): anyone that has the approval of Jewish controlled infrastructure and is being promoted by fed assets should be viewed through a thick lens of suspicion.

I think if people continually promote multiple federal informants, like Ramzpaul has into the current year, that it is safe to assume they are malicious actors.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185528/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164608869554933760): he does not have a different approach at all. His continued and nonstop approach is to promote only fed-controlled bad actors and attack people who are actually censored and persecuted by the federal machine.

Not because of wanting to stop promoting them, but because Anglin pointed out the continued hypocrisy of this guy promoting costumed feds.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185420/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164606571042811905): HC is dead now. This is about Ramzpaul's complete and consistent record of falsely accusing people of being costumed federal informants while repeatedly promoting multiple costumed federal informants.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185420/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164606571042811905): 2014 is not decades ago, and it was the exact time he was accusing Anglin of engaging in Covington's actual behavior.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185420/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164606571042811905): there are plenty of milquetoast people who are totally deplatformed. Ramzpaul is verified on Twitter, and Ramzpaul promotes federal informants.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185448/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164607580498518016): 2014 was after Covington wore Nazi outfits and gave over his org to the ATF.  He's never denounced Covington, and continually defended him. He's never said "sorry for promoting a federal asset to my viewers" while attacking other legitimate actors with false claims of being feds.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185420/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164606571042811905): You can establish that he's simply a public advocate for and promoter of federal informants that wear Nazi costumes.  While simultaneously attacking legitimate actors who are not federal informants and do not wear Nazi costumes.  Only a fed would do that.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185420/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164606571042811905): I don't care if you're a fan of Anglin or not -- the issue is if Ramzpaul promotes federal assets who wear Nazi costumes while accusing people who are not federal assets nor wear Nazi costumes of doing the same.   And he does.  And that's obvious COINTELPRO behavior.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822185420/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164606571042811905): Ramzpaul didn't simply meet up with Covington in 2014. He did multiple hours of interviews and coverage of him on his YouTube channel, and this was well after it was a well-established matter of public record that Covington gave his org to an ATF informant and wore Nazi costumes.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822183242/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164604670712659970): he's also shilled support of multiple State Department owned groups in Ukraine.

Ramzpaul promoted multiple costumists (Covington, TWP, Parrott, Hovater)  Wallace actually leveraged mod access to dox racists to SPLC.
* [22 August 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190822183242/https://twitter.com/vapingheals/status/1164604670712659970): it's entirely suspect that  @PunishedMemeson  pretends that it's irrelevant that obvious State Department asset Ramzpaul smeared Anglin as a costumed neo-Nazi fed while actually being friends with a known fed informant who is the single most famous unironic neo-Nazi costumist.

They used their influence as Gab's registrar to lobby for specific users on the site to be banned.

Their only major and tangible demand: that links to a prominent political website from the USA be removed entirely. How is this not foreign election meddling? pic.twitter.com/Yw764HBrD2

You're talking people that can't even pick up the garbage, it piles high in the streets amid riots. If you and Taleb are so intent on undermining our standards and metrics, move to his homeland where there aren't any.

Then came the grenade attacks and highest European rape rate.  No government can mitigate the damage by violent, low-IQ foreigners infesting a nation. They can just put them in prison after they rape and murder.

Truly intelligent people care about IQ because low IQ populations ruin nations.

You think R.L. Stine or J.K. Rowling are geniuses, or particularly qualified to talk about random social issues?
